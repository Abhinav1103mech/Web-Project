# How web works

### Very Basic Idea

As shown in the diagram, the basic principle is user makes a request to a particular web page using the domain name of the website for instance www.wikipeda.com which is mapped to the required ip address via DNS server (DNS stands for Domain name system) after that a "request" to the IP is made by the browser and server sends back a response.
